//   - test "decompilation" cost
//   - asm generator should output pseudo code too
//   - make the java-like code available in a .toString()?
//     and the ranges array?
//   - if there is an interval that no range ever covers
//     (which would be ... really weird), then we need not
//     cover the "full" number line?
//   - play w/ asm
//     - instance vars in the class vs incoming array
//     - which way to branch
//   - later
//     - increment a multi-valued field
//     - allow changing what's done when a range matches
//       (it's hardwired to incrementing counters, now)
